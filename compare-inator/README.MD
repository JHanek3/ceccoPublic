## Problem
Mike presented the issue "I would like a way to compare the files in my WIP folder with the files in my done folder<br/>

## Solution
Create a GUI for chosing the two folder paths<br/>
Go through all files in each folder. If A not in B record it, if B not in A record it<br/>
Output the records to a .csv
<p>Needs to be recursive, folder present check to see if folder and files are in other</p>
